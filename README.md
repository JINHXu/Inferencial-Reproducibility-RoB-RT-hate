This project intends to examine the inferencial reproducibility of the SOTA model proposed in ... for hate speech detection. 

In order to 

### Measuring Data: data properties to consider

- Word rarity [Platanios et al., 2019]: Negative log of empirical probabilities of words in segment, higher value means higher rarity.

- Flesch-Kincaid readability [Kincaid et al., 1975]: Pro-rates words/sentences and syllables/word; in principle unbounded, but interpretation scheme exists for ranges from 0 (difficult) to 100 (easy).

- Sentence Length

### Meta-parameters?

### Random Seeds?
